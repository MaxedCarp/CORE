# - CORE - 
"CORE" is an essential component to the logging functions of my Discord bots, dedicated to keeping an eye on keep_alive modules.
CORE's primary role is to detect and report any uptime issues with one of my bots as soon as they happen and report them directly to me.

In the future, I plan on expanding this to a websocket and creating a web page for real time view.
